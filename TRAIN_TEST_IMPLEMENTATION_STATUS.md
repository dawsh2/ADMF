# Train/Test Split Implementation Status

## Goal
Implement a parameter grid search over training data, then hygienically transition to test data with no state leakage, dynamically loading optimal parameters for each detected regime.

## Implementation Complete âœ…

### 1. **Regime-Specific Optimization**
- `OptimizationRunner.optimize_regime_specific()` - Runs grid search and analyzes performance by regime
- `RegimePerformanceAnalyzer` - Tracks and aggregates performance metrics per regime
- Fixed trade count aggregation issue

### 2. **Train/Test Split with Dynamic Switching**
- `OptimizationRunner.optimize_regime_specific_with_split()` - Complete workflow:
  - Configures data handler with train/test split
  - Runs optimization on training data only
  - Extracts best parameters per regime
  - Tests with RegimeAdaptiveStrategy using dynamic parameter switching

### 3. **RegimeAdaptiveStrategy**
- Subscribes to CLASSIFICATION events
- Dynamically switches parameters when regime changes
- Maintains complete state isolation between regimes

### 4. **Configuration**
Created `config_optimization_train_test.yaml` with:
- 80/20 train/test split
- Component-based strategy definition
- Regime-specific optimization settings

### 5. **Fixed Issues**
- Implemented `_initialize_components_from_config()` in base Strategy class
- Fixed imports for TrueCrossoverRule
- Updated configuration to use `class_path` format
- Fixed trade count tracking in regime analyzer

## Current Status

The implementation is complete but needs testing. When you run:
```bash
python main_ultimate.py --config config/config_optimization_train_test.yaml --bars 5000
```

It will:
1. Load 5000 bars and split into 4000 train / 1000 test
2. Run grid search on training data
3. Find best parameters for each regime
4. Run test with RegimeAdaptiveStrategy that switches parameters dynamically
5. Report performance on both train and test sets

## Code Quality
- Clean separation of concerns
- No state leakage between train/test phases
- Proper dependency injection and isolation
- Event-driven regime switching

The system is ready for hygienic train/test evaluation with dynamic regime-based parameter switching!
