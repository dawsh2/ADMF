# OOS Test vs Production Results Comparison

## Results Summary

### Optimizer's Adaptive Test (OOS)
- **Final Portfolio Value: 99967.81**
- **Regimes**: default, trending_down, ranging_low_vol, trending_up_low_vol

### Production Backtest
- **Final Portfolio Value: 99870.04**
- **Regimes**: default, ranging_low_vol (only 2 regimes!)
- **Total Trades**: 11 (2 + 9)

## Analysis

### Difference
- **Absolute**: 99967.81 - 99870.04 = **97.77**
- **Percentage**: (97.77 / 99967.81) × 100 = **0.098%**

### ❌ Results DO NOT Match!

The ~0.1% difference indicates there are discrepancies between the two runs.

## Key Observations

1. **Different Regimes Detected**:
   - OOS Test detected 4 regimes: default, trending_down, ranging_low_vol, trending_up_low_vol
   - Production only detected 2 regimes: default, ranging_low_vol
   - Missing in production: trending_down, trending_up_low_vol

2. **Very Few Trades**:
   - Production only made 11 trades total
   - This suggests the strategy isn't generating many signals

## Root Cause Analysis

The mismatch is likely due to:

1. **RegimeDetector State Differences**:
   - The RegimeDetector in production is not detecting the same regimes
   - This could be due to:
     - Different initialization state
     - Indicators not warmed up properly
     - Different starting conditions

2. **Component Initialization Order**:
   - The optimizer might be initializing components differently
   - RegimeDetector might have different indicator states

3. **Data Processing Differences**:
   - The test dataset might be processed differently
   - Bar timestamps or order could differ

## Next Steps

1. **Part 1.2**: Check for RegimeDetector indicator resets
2. **Part 1.4**: Use enhanced signal analysis to trace differences
3. **Add Detailed Logging**: Track regime detection bar-by-bar

The 0.098% difference is small but significant enough to investigate further.
