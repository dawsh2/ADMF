# Isolated Evaluation Implementation Status

## Current Issues

1. **Complete containerization is complex** - Creating fresh instances of all components (data handler, portfolio, etc.) requires proper configuration copying which is proving difficult.

2. **Data Handler Configuration** - The fresh data handler needs symbol and csv_file_path configuration which isn't being properly transferred.

## Alternative Approach

Instead of complete containerization, we could:

1. **Keep shared components** but ensure proper reset between evaluations
2. **Focus on portfolio isolation** - The main issue is P&L contamination from the portfolio
3. **Use synchronization** to ensure components are reset in the right order

## Simpler Fix

For now, the simplest fix might be to:
1. Ensure portfolio.reset() is properly called and verified
2. Add a verification that portfolio has 0 realized P&L before each evaluation
3. Log warnings if portfolio state is not clean

This would solve the immediate problem of identical scores due to P&L contamination while we work on a more complete containerization solution.
