print("Even with cold start reset, the RegimeDetector behaves differently because:")

print("1. In Optimizer (even with reset):")
print("   - Data handler has full 1000 bars loaded")
print("   - When set to 'test' mode, it provides bars 800-999")
print("   - These are labeled as bars 800, 801, 802... 999")
print("   - RegimeDetector sees these as high bar numbers")

print("2. In Production:")
print("   - Data handler loads ONLY test data (200 bars)")
print("   - Bars are labeled as 0, 1, 2... 199")
print("   - RegimeDetector sees these as low bar numbers")

print("WHY THIS MATTERS:")

print("- Warmup calculations")
print("- State management")
print("- Logging or debugging")

print("EVEN WITH RESET:")
print("- The bar numbering difference could cause subtle behavior changes")
print("- The data handler itself might behave differently")

print("SOLUTION:")
print("We need to ensure both runs see IDENTICAL data with IDENTICAL bar numbers.")
print("")

print("Option 1: Make production match optimizer")
print("  - Load full dataset in production")
print("  - Skip to bar 800")

print("Option 2: Make optimizer match production")  
print("  - Create new data handler for test")
print("  - Load only test data")
print("  - Process bars 0-199")
