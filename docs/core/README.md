# Core Module

The Core module provides foundational infrastructure services that all other modules depend on, implementing critical patterns for component lifecycle, configuration, dependency injection, and event management.

## Component Lifecycle System

```
Component (Abstract)
  └── initialize(context)
  └── initialize_event_subscriptions()
  └── start()
  └── stop()
  └── reset()
  └── teardown()
```

All system components inherit from the `Component` base class, which enforces a consistent lifecycle pattern with clearly defined states:

- `initialize(context)`: Set up the component with dependencies from context
- `initialize_event_subscriptions()`: Set up event subscriptions
- `start()`: Begin component operation
- `stop()`: End component operation
- `reset()`: Clear internal state while preserving configuration
- `teardown()`: Release resources and unsubscribe from events

## Dependency Injection Container

The Container implements a service locator pattern for dependency management, allowing components to request their dependencies via the context object.

## Configuration System

The configuration system provides hierarchical access to settings with validation, environment variable support, and centralized management.

## Event System

The event system enables loosely coupled communication between components through a standardized publish/subscribe pattern. See the implementation guide for details on the event system architecture.

## Bootstrap System

The bootstrap system orchestrates the initialization of the entire application, managing component creation, dependency injection, and startup sequencing.

## Analytics Framework

The analytics framework, a submodule of the Core module, provides performance measurement, statistics calculation, and reporting capabilities.

## Utility Libraries

The Core module provides reusable utility libraries that are used across the system:

- OrderValidator: Standardized order validation
- ThreadSafeCollections: Thread-safe data structures
- SubscriptionManager: Clean event subscription management
- ErrorHandling: Standardized error handling patterns
- TimeUtils: Time-related operations and formatting
