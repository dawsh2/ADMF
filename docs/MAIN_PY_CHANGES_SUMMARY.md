# main.py Changes Summary

## What We Changed

### 1. Added Import for EnhancedOptimizerV2
**Line 28**: Added import for the new optimizer that uses BacktestEngine
```python
from src.strategy.optimization.enhanced_optimizer_v2 import EnhancedOptimizerV2
```

### 2. Updated Optimizer Registration
**Line 219**: Changed from EnhancedOptimizer to EnhancedOptimizerV2
```python
container.register_type("optimizer_service", EnhancedOptimizerV2, True, constructor_kwargs=optimizer_args)
```

### 3. Updated Type Hint
**Line 242**: Updated type hint for the optimizer variable
```python
optimizer: EnhancedOptimizerV2 = container.resolve("optimizer_service")
```

## What This Means

When you run optimization now:
```bash
python3 main.py --config config/config.yaml --optimize
```

The system will use EnhancedOptimizerV2, which:
- Uses BacktestEngine for all backtest runs
- Ensures consistent behavior between grid search and adaptive test
- Provides guaranteed cold starts for all components
- Uses the same initialization order as production

## Key Benefits

1. **Part 1.1 SOLVED**: Cold starts are guaranteed by BacktestEngine
2. **Consistency**: Same backtest execution path everywhere
3. **Maintainability**: Backtest logic is centralized in BacktestEngine
4. **Future-proof**: Easy to add new features to BacktestEngine

## Note

EnhancedOptimizerV2 inherits from EnhancedOptimizer, so it has all the same methods plus:
- Uses BacktestEngine for `_perform_single_backtest_run`
- Uses BacktestEngine for `run_adaptive_test`
- Includes ResultsManager for better result handling
- Includes ParameterManager for version tracking

The optimizer will work exactly as before, but with better consistency and maintainability!
