## Notes on Priority

1. The immediate priority is implementing the adaptive ensemble strategy with dynamic parameter loading
2. Paper trading API integration is the next critical step for validating strategies in a real market environment
3. Optimization framework enhancements should be implemented before live trading to ensure optimal strategy parameters
4. Walk-forward validation is essential before committing to any live trading deployment
5. Live trading should only be attempted after thorough validation and paper trading testing
