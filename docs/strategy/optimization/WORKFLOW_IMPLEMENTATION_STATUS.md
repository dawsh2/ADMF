# Workflow Optimization Implementation Status

## Overview

The workflow orchestrator has been implemented to work with the existing ADMF optimization infrastructure, which has optimization built into the base components as per the original design.

## Implementation Approach

### 1. **Using Existing Infrastructure**
- All components inherit from `ComponentBase` which has built-in optimization methods
- Strategies, indicators, rules all implement: `get_parameter_space()`, `apply_parameters()`, etc.
- No separate "optimizable" classes needed - optimization is intrinsic to components

### 2. **Component Optimizer**
- Works with any `ComponentBase`-derived component
- Uses the component's built-in optimization interface
- Supports grid search (with other methods easy to add)
- Can optimize both parameters and weights

### 3. **Workflow Orchestrator**
- Reads workflow steps from configuration
- Executes optimization steps in order with dependency management
- Uses `ComponentOptimizer` for rulewise optimization
- Supports weight optimization for ensemble strategies

## Current Capabilities

### ✅ Implemented
1. **Component-based optimization**
   - Can optimize any component that implements the interface
   - Pattern matching to select components (e.g., "rsi_*")
   - Results saved to optimization_results directory

2. **Weight optimization**
   - Detects weight parameters in strategies
   - Optimizes weights using same infrastructure
   - Works with existing ensemble strategies

3. **Workflow execution**
   - Reads workflow from YAML config
   - Executes steps in order
   - Respects dependencies between steps
   - Saves results for each step

### ⚠️ Simplified Implementation
1. **Evaluator**
   - Currently delegates to standard optimizer for evaluation
   - In production, would run isolated backtests per parameter set

2. **Joint optimization**
   - Currently optimizes components sequentially
   - Could be extended for true joint optimization

## Example Usage

```yaml
optimization:
  workflow:
    # Optimize MA crossover parameters
    - name: "optimize_ma"
      type: "rulewise"
      targets: []  # Empty = optimize strategy itself
      method: "grid_search"
      
    # Optimize RSI components
    - name: "optimize_rsi"
      type: "rulewise"
      targets: ["rsi_*"]
      method: "grid_search"
      
    # Optimize ensemble weights
    - name: "optimize_weights"
      type: "ensemble_weights"
      method: "grid_search"
      depends_on: ["optimize_ma", "optimize_rsi"]
```

## Integration Points

1. **ComponentBase** - All components have optimization methods
2. **Strategy** - Manages sub-components (indicators, rules)
3. **OptimizationEntrypoint** - Standard optimizer used for evaluation
4. **WorkflowOrchestrator** - Coordinates the optimization process

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **No parallel infrastructure** - Uses existing component design
2. **Flexible** - Any component can be optimized
3. **Extensible** - Easy to add new optimization methods
4. **Config-driven** - Workflows defined in YAML
5. **Traceable** - All results saved with metadata

## Next Steps

1. **Implement proper evaluator** that runs isolated backtests
2. **Add more optimization methods** (genetic, bayesian, etc.)
3. **Support joint optimization** of multiple components
4. **Add progress reporting** and visualization
5. **Implement checkpoint/resume** for long optimizations
