# Workflow Orchestrator Implementation Status

## Overview

The workflow orchestrator has been created to enable config-driven optimization workflows as requested. However, the actual optimization implementations are still pending.

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed
1. **Workflow Orchestrator Infrastructure**
   - Created `OptimizationWorkflowOrchestrator` class
   - Integrated with `AppRunner` for --optimize mode
   - Added to Bootstrap standard components
   - Config-driven workflow parsing and validation
   - Dependency management between workflow steps

2. **Configuration Support**
   - Workflow steps defined in YAML config
   - Support for different optimization types (rulewise, ensemble_weights, regime_optimization)
   - Step dependencies and execution order

3. **Integration**
   - AppRunner checks for workflow_orchestrator first
   - Falls back to legacy optimizer if no workflow defined
   - Backward compatible with existing configs

### ⚠️ Pending Implementation

1. **Component Optimizer** (rulewise optimization)
   - The `ComponentOptimizer` class was stubbed but not implemented
   - Would need to:
     - Extract parameter spaces from components
     - Run grid search or genetic optimization on component parameters
     - Apply optimized parameters back to components
   - Currently delegates to existing optimizer

2. **Ensemble Weight Optimization**
   - Placeholder implementation only
   - Would need to:
     - Optimize signal weights for ensemble strategies
     - Support per-regime weight optimization
     - Integrate with genetic algorithm for weight search

3. **Full Regime Optimization via Workflow**
   - Currently uses placeholder
   - Would integrate with existing regime optimization logic

## Why Not Fully Implemented

The component-based optimization requires:
1. Components to expose their parameter spaces (partially done in ComponentBase)
2. A way to evaluate component performance in isolation
3. Integration with backtest engine for parameter evaluation

Since we're deprecating EnhancedOptimizer in favor of OptimizationEntrypoint/OptimizationRunner, the full implementation should build on that foundation rather than the deprecated code.

## Current Behavior

When you run with `--optimize` and a workflow config:
1. The workflow orchestrator is created and initialized
2. It reads the workflow steps from config
3. For each step:
   - **rulewise**: Logs that it's not implemented, delegates to standard optimizer
   - **ensemble_weights**: Returns pending_implementation status
   - **regime_optimization**: Returns pending_implementation status

## Next Steps

To fully implement the config-driven optimization:

1. **Option A**: Extend OptimizationRunner to support component optimization
   - Add methods for optimizing individual components
   - Integrate with existing backtest infrastructure

2. **Option B**: Create minimal ComponentOptimizer that works with OptimizationRunner
   - Focus on parameter extraction and application
   - Let OptimizationRunner handle the actual optimization

3. **Option C**: Use workflow orchestrator as a configuration layer only
   - Parse workflow config
   - Translate to calls to OptimizationEntrypoint with different configs
   - This is the simplest approach

## Recommendation

Given that we're deprecating EnhancedOptimizer, I recommend Option C:
- Keep the workflow orchestrator as a configuration interpreter
- Translate workflow steps into appropriate OptimizationEntrypoint configurations
- This leverages existing, working optimization code
- Minimal new code to maintain

The infrastructure is in place - the actual optimization logic can be added incrementally without breaking existing functionality.
