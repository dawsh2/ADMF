# Isolated Optimization Implementation Progress

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Component Inheritance Fixed ✓
- Updated `RuleBase` to inherit from `ComponentBase` instead of `StrategyComponent`
- Updated `IndicatorBase` to inherit from `ComponentBase` instead of `StrategyComponent`
- All rule and indicator classes now have `instance_name` attribute
- Added proper lifecycle methods (`_initialize`, `_start`, `_stop`)
- Added optimization interface methods (`get_parameter_space`, `validate_parameters`, `apply_parameters`, `get_optimizable_parameters`)

### 2. Base Classes Updated ✓
- `CrossoverRule` now properly inherits from updated `RuleBase`
- `ThresholdRule` now properly inherits from updated `RuleBase`
- `MovingAverageIndicator` now properly inherits from updated `IndicatorBase`
- `RSIIndicator` now properly inherits from updated `IndicatorBase`
- All constructors updated to use `instance_name` parameter

### 3. Workflow Orchestrator Updates ✓
- Fixed attribute access to handle both `instance_name` and `name`
- Added support for "regime" optimization type
- Fixed grid search parameter passing issue

## Current Issues

### 1. Grid Search Parameter Issue
The `ComponentOptimizer._grid_search()` method was receiving unexpected `metric` parameter. This has been fixed by filtering kwargs before passing to `_grid_search()`.

### 2. Container Access Issue
The workflow orchestrator is having trouble accessing the container in some contexts. This needs further investigation.

### 3. Isolated Evaluator Setup
The isolated evaluator needs to be properly configured with required components (backtest_runner, data_handler, etc.)

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Isolated Optimization Implementation**
   - Ensure isolated evaluator is properly initialized
   - Fix container access issues
   - Implement proper backtest evaluation for isolated components

2. **Verify Optimization Reduction**
   - Once working, verify that isolated optimization reduces backtests from 11,907 to ~85
   - MA rule in isolation: 9 backtests (3 short × 3 long window values)
   - RSI rule in isolation: 27 backtests (3 period × 3 oversold × 3 overbought)
   - Weight optimization: 49 backtests (7 weight combinations)
   - Total: ~85 backtests

3. **Implement Regime Optimization**
   - Complete the placeholder `_run_regime_optimization` method
   - Integrate with existing regime detection and parameter switching

## Summary

The core architectural changes to support isolated optimization are complete. All strategy components now properly inherit from `ComponentBase` and have the required optimization interface. The remaining work is primarily around fixing the execution flow and ensuring the isolated evaluator can properly test components independently.

This implementation follows the documented architecture in:
- `docs/modules/strategy/STRATEGY.MD` - Component architecture with built-in optimization
- `docs/modules/strategy/OPTIMIZATION.MD` - Optimization framework design
- `ISOLATED_OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.MD` - Specific isolated optimization approach
