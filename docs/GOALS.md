# ADMF Project Goals

## Primary Goals

Our primary goal is to implement enough of the ADMF system to run a rudimentary backtest with the following features:

1. **Train/Test Splitting**: Proper data isolation between training and testing periods to prevent lookahead bias and ensure valid strategy evaluation.

2. **Grid Search Optimization**: Implement a parameter optimization framework for a simple strategy (moving average crossover), allowing us to find optimal parameters using the training dataset.

3. **Default Components**: Utilize default risk and position management components that implement standard practices without unnecessary complexity.

4. **Data Source**: Use the `data/SPY_1min.csv` data file as our primary test dataset.

## Implementation Scope

To achieve these goals, we will focus on implementing:

1. **Core Module**:
   - Basic event system for inter-component communication
   - Component lifecycle management
   - Dependency injection framework
   - Configuration system
   - Analytics framework (as a submodule of Core) for performance measurement and reporting

2. **Data Module**:
   - Data loading from CSV files
   - Train/test splitting with proper isolation
   - Bar synchronization for single-symbol testing

3. **Strategy Module**:
   - Simple moving average crossover strategy
   - Parameter definition and management
   - Signal generation based on crossover events

4. **Risk Module**:
   - Basic position sizing (fixed size or percentage of equity)
   - Simple portfolio management
   - Signal to order conversion

5. **Execution Module**:
   - Order management
   - Simple broker simulation with basic slippage and commission models
   - Backtest coordination and results collection

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. We can run a complete backtest of the moving average crossover strategy on SPY data
2. The system properly separates training and testing data
3. We can perform a grid search optimization on the training data
4. The optimized parameters can be applied to the test data
5. Performance metrics are calculated and reported correctly

## Next Phase: Ensemble Strategy with Regime Filters

After achieving the primary goals, our next step will be to implement an ensemble strategy system with the following capabilities:

1. **Multiple Rule-Based Strategies**: Create a framework for combining multiple rule-based strategies, each optimized independently.

2. **Regime Identification**: Implement regime filters to identify different market conditions (trending, mean-reverting, volatile, etc.).

3. **Regime-Specific Optimization**: Optimize each strategy component under distinct market regimes separately.

4. **Genetic Algorithm Weighting**: Use genetic algorithms to determine optimal weights for combining strategy components based on historical performance in different regimes.

5. **Composite Strategy Framework**: Develop a composite strategy framework that can dynamically adjust weights based on detected market regimes. The regime filter ability will likely be implemented as an instance of a composite strategy.

This advanced phase will enable the system to adapt to changing market conditions by activating different strategies or adjusting their weights based on the detected regime, potentially improving overall performance and robustness.

## Future Extensions

Beyond the ensemble strategy phase, we may further extend the system to include:

1. Multi-symbol backtesting
2. More sophisticated strategies
3. Advanced risk management techniques
4. More realistic broker simulation
5. Walk-forward optimization
6. Machine learning integration
